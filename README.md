# Solstice's Galaxy

Solstice was a company aiming at making accurate revenue attribution for B2B marketers.

We closed down in August 2023, due to a lack of product market fit.

The whole project was composed of different applications and services, in a micro-service architecture and written in TypeScript - all hosted in a Turborepo monorepo.

After the company closed down, we decided to open-source the full-stack Next.js project Nebula that was the client-facing UI (as well as the dependent DB package named cosmos). We decided to not include other services such as the analytics infrastructure and attribution algorithms.

The project Nebula contains notably;
- A modern dark design system
- A multi-step onboarding
- An auth infrastructure 

And more that you can find.


Due to the speed at which we were going, it's mostly a first-version that is not free of bugs nor covered by test coverage. 

Nonethless, it is modern full-stack projects with bits I hope you can get inspired by or copy for your own project as it could save you precious days of development.
